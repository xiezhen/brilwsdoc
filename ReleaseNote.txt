There is a major release of brilws 3.8.1. Software update is not mandatory. The documentation is updated in https://cms-service-lumi.web.cern.ch/cms-service-lumi/brilwsdoc.html

Release 3.8.1 has no functional change and it is brought to be compatible with python3.10. Due to major differences between python3.7 and python>=3.10, we dropped support for python2 from this release. The last python2 compatible software is version 3.7.4. Although moving to python3 is encouraged, as long as there is no change in the brilws functionality, you can stay with 3.7.4. The documentation matching old versions can be found in the "Docs" tab under the document title.
  
Light users of bril commandline tools are encouraged to use the docker image method and skip reading the message below.

The instruction for the virtual environment based method is the following:

Brilconda environments compatible to this release can be found in /cvmfs/cms-bril.cern.ch/brilconda3 and brilconda310

Above instruction does not cover all user installation scenarios, for more complicated use cases please refer to the documentation.
